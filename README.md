## Technical Details
- The app uses https://github.com/sakethvarma397/openai-proxy  as a proxy server for requests, which is independently deployed. This is to overcome the CORS issues for the images generated
- The default prompt can be customized in the https://github.com/sakethvarma397/openai-proxy to allow more variety.
